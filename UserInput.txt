Both methods achieve the same goal, but they have some differences:

BufferedReader is generally preferred for reading input character streams because it's more efficient, especially for reading large amounts of text.
Scanner is more convenient for parsing input of primitive types and strings using regular expressions.
BufferedReader requires handling IOException, whereas Scanner does not.
Scanner has more methods for parsing input, such as nextInt(), nextDouble(), etc., which can be useful when you need to read specific types of input.
Choose the one that best suits your needs based on the requirements of your application.
