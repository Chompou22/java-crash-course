StringBuffer:

Mutability: Mutable (content can be changed).
Thread Safety: Thread-safe (synchronized methods).
Performance: Slower compared to StringBuilder due to synchronization.
Usage: Suitable in multi-threaded environments where thread safety is critical.
StringBuilder:

Mutability: Mutable (content can be changed).
Thread Safety: Not thread-safe.
Performance: Faster compared to StringBuffer due to lack of synchronization.
Usage: Efficient for single-threaded scenarios or when thread safety is managed externally.

Common Characteristics:
Both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are classes in Java's java.lang package.
Both are used for dynamic string manipulation.

Choosing Between Them:

Use StringBuffer When:

Thread safety is a priority in a multi-threaded environment.
Synchronization is needed to prevent concurrent modifications.
Use StringBuilder When:

Thread safety is not a concern (single-threaded scenario).
Performance is crucial, and external synchronization can be managed.
Understanding the trade-offs helps in selecting the appropriate class based on the specific requirements of your program.
