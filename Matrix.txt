Yes, that's correct.
The concept of multi-dimensional arrays,
including 2D arrays (matrices) and 3D arrays, is often related to matrix representation.
In mathematics and computer science, matrices are a fundamental concept used for various purposes,
such as linear algebra, graphics, and scientific computing.

For example:

A 2D array can be viewed as a matrix, where each element corresponds to a cell in the matrix,
identified by row and column indices.

A 3D array can be conceptualized as a collection of 2D arrays (matrices) arranged in layers.

The structure of multi-dimensional arrays is flexible,
and you can model them to represent different types of data and relationships.
In many programming applications,
you'll encounter situations where matrices or
multi-dimensional arrays are used to solve problems related to tabular data, graphics, simulations, and more.

Whether it's for representing images, storing tabular data, or performing mathematical operations, the matrix concept often aligns well with the structure and functionality provided by multi-dimensional arrays in programming languages.
