In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to specify the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, fields, and other members within a program. There are four main access modifiers in Java:

Public (public):

Members declared as public are accessible from any other class.
There is no restriction on accessing public members.
java
Copy code
public class MyClass {
    public int myField;
    public void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
Private (private):

Members declared as private are accessible only within the same class.
They are not visible to any other class, even subclasses.
java
Copy code
public class MyClass {
    private int myField;
    private void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
Protected (protected):

Members declared as protected are accessible within the same class, subclasses, and within the same package.
They are not accessible outside the package if the subclass is in a different package.
java
Copy code
public class MyClass {
    protected int myField;
    protected void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
Default (Package-Private):

If no access modifier is specified (default), the member is accessible only within the same package.
It is not visible to classes outside the package, even if they are subclasses.
java
Copy code
class MyClass {
    int myField;  // Default access modifier
    void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
