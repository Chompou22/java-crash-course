Sure! Here's a simplified summary of the types of interfaces in Java:

Normal Interface: An interface with methods to define behavior for classes.

Functional Interface: An interface with only one method, used for lambda expressions.

Marker Interface: An interface with no methods, used to mark classes for special treatment.

SAM Interface: Another term for a functional interface, emphasizing the single method.

Default Interface: An interface with default method implementations for backward compatibility.

Static Interface: An interface with static methods that can be called without an instance.

These types of interfaces serve different purposes in Java programming, providing flexibility and enabling various programming paradigms.
