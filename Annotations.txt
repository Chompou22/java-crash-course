Certainly! Here's a simplified explanation of annotations in Java, along with a summary:

Explanation:
Annotations in Java are like little notes you can attach to your code to give extra information to the compiler or other tools. They start with the @ symbol and can be placed on different parts of your code, like classes, methods, or fields.

For example, if you want to mark a method as no longer recommended to use, you can add @Deprecated above it. Or, if you want to silence a specific warning from the compiler, you can use @SuppressWarnings.

You can also create your own custom annotations to add specific information or behavior to your code. These custom annotations are defined using @interface.

Annotations can be processed by special tools called annotation processors, which can do various things based on the annotations in your code.

Summary:
Annotations: Little notes in your code starting with @.
Built-in Annotations: Pre-defined annotations provided by Java, like @Override, @Deprecated, and @SuppressWarnings.
Custom Annotations: Annotations you create yourself using @interface.
Usage: Used to give extra information to the compiler, mark code as deprecated, suppress warnings, and more.
Annotation Processors: Tools that can do special tasks based on the annotations in your code.
Annotations are like sticky notes for your code, providing extra information and enabling various features and tools in Java development.
