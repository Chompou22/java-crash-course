Certainly! Here's a concise summary of the abstract keyword in Java:

Abstract Classes:

Abstract classes are declared with the abstract keyword.
They cannot be instantiated directly.
May contain both abstract (without implementation) and concrete (with implementation) methods.
Can have fields, constructors, and regular methods.
Provide a common interface for a group of related classes.
Abstract Methods:

Abstract methods are declared with the abstract keyword and have no implementation.
Must be declared within an abstract class.
Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for all abstract methods unless they are also declared as abstract.
Usage:

Abstract classes are used to define common behavior and characteristics for a group of related classes.
They provide a way to achieve abstraction and polymorphism in Java.
Cannot Be Instantiated:

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly using the new keyword.
They can only be extended by other classes, which must provide concrete implementations for abstract methods.
In summary, the abstract keyword allows for the creation of abstract classes and methods in Java, enabling abstraction, defining common interfaces, and enforcing concrete implementations in subclasses.
