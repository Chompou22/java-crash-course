Certainly! Here's a concise overview of the final keyword in Java:

Final Variables:

A final variable cannot be reassigned once initialized.
It must be initialized during declaration or in the constructor.
Example:

java
Copy code
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
Final Methods:

A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
Adding final to a method prevents further modification in subclasses.
Example:

java
Copy code
class Parent {
    final void display() {
        // method implementation
    }
}
Final Classes:

A final class cannot be extended or subclassed.
It prevents inheritance for that class.
Example:

java
Copy code
final class FinalClass {
    // class implementation
}
Final Parameters:

A final parameter in a method cannot be modified within the method.
It is a good practice for method parameters when their values should not change.
Example:

java
Copy code
void process(final int value) {
    // value cannot be modified within this method
}
Benefits of final:

Improves code safety and robustness.
Supports optimization by the compiler.
Enhances code readability and intent.
Remember: final is about making elements (variables, methods, classes) immutable or preventing further modification or extension.
