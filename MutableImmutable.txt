Mutable Strings:

Definition: Can be modified after creation.
Example: StringBuilder and StringBuffer in Java.
Advantages: Efficient for frequent modifications.
Disadvantages: Not thread-safe, potential for unexpected changes.
Immutable Strings:

Definition: Cannot be changed after creation.
Example: Java's String class.
Advantages: Thread-safe, ensures content integrity.
Disadvantages: Less efficient for frequent modifications, new object creation.
Choosing:

Use Mutable Strings When:

Frequent dynamic modifications are needed.
Efficiency is crucial.
Use Immutable Strings When:

Thread safety is essential.
String content should remain constant.
Understanding trade-offs helps in making informed decisions based on application needs.
