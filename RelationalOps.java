Equal to (==): a == b is true for equal values.
Not equal to (!=): a != b is true for different values.
Greater than (>): a > b is true if a is greater than b.
Less than (<): a < b is true if a is less than b.
Greater than or equal to (>=): a >= b is true if a is greater than or equal to b.
Less than or equal to (<=): a <= b is true if a is less than or equal to b.
